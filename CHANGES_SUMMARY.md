# Changes Made for Vercel Deployment

## Summary
Fixed the 404 error when registering on Vercel by creating proper serverless function configuration.

## Files Created

### 1. `vercel.json`
- Configuration file that tells Vercel how to route requests
- Routes `/api/*` to the serverless function
- Routes all other requests to the frontend

### 2. `api/index.js`
- Serverless function entry point for Express backend
- Handles all API routes (`/api/auth`, `/api/tax`, etc.)
- Manages MongoDB connection for serverless environment
- Includes all security middleware and rate limiting

### 3. `api/package.json`
- Dependencies needed for the serverless API function
- Ensures all backend packages are available in Vercel

### 4. `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Comprehensive deployment guide
- Environment variable setup instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices for security

### 5. `DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md`
- Quick reference for deployment
- Step-by-step instructions
- Common issues and solutions

## How It Works

### Before (404 Error)
```
Request: POST /api/auth/register
Vercel: "I don't know what /api/auth/register is"
Result: 404 Not Found
```

### After (Working)
```
Request: POST /api/auth/register
Vercel: vercel.json → "/api/(.*)" → "/api/index.js"
Express: Routes to authRoutes → register controller
MongoDB: Creates user in database
Result: 201 Created with user data
```

## Key Changes

1. **Serverless Architecture**: Converted Express app to work in Vercel's serverless environment
2. **Database Connection**: Optimized MongoDB connection for serverless (connection pooling)
3. **CORS Configuration**: Updated to work with Vercel domains
4. **Routing**: Proper routing between API and frontend

## Next Steps for You

1. **Push to Git**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - add serverless configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
   - Add environment variables (see DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md)
   - Deploy

3. **Test**:
   - Visit your Vercel deployment
   - Try registering a new account
   - Should work without 404 errors!

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure to set these in Vercel:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Strong random secret (32+ chars)
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` - Strong random secret (32+ chars)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"

## Testing Locally

You can still test locally as before:
```bash
npm run dev:full
```

The Vercel changes only affect production deployment.
