# Browser Test Framework Selection

For modern React/Vite projects, Playwright is recommended for its speed, reliability, and first-class TypeScript support. Cypress is also popular and easy to set up. Selenium is more legacy and less developer-friendly for modern JS apps.

**Recommendation:** Use Playwright for automated browser tests.

Next steps:
1. Install Playwright and its dependencies.
2. Scaffold Playwright test structure.
3. Add sample test and configuration.
